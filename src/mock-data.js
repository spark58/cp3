    Instruction: "Make the filling by mixing together the room-temperature cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Mix in the eggs and vanilla, again mixing until smooth. To avoid beating too much air into the batter, use a mixer set at low-medium speed. To avoid lumps, make sure the cream cheese is softened, and/or at room temperature."

Bake for an additional 10 minutes (for a total of about 30 minutes). A digital thermometer inserted into the filling 1\" from the edge should read between 165°F and 170°F; the filling won't look entirely set in the center."
